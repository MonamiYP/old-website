                <h4>A small intorduction to machine learning</h4>
                <p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way humans learn, graually improving its accuracy. It builds a model based on sample data, known as trining data, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.</p><br>
                <p>In this article I will explore a few of the most common and simple algorithms used to predict and model data. Before that, however, we have to know a bit abou the three main types of algorithms: supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning.</p>

                <h4>Types of Machine Learning Algorithms</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Supervised learning - creates a model to predict an outcome based on labeled data. It is told the correct output and compares its own output which informs the subsequent steps, adjusting itself along the way. For example, the machine gets an image of a dog and it has to predict wether it's a dog or a cat.</li><br>
                    <li>Unsupervised learning - determines patterns in unlabeled data, often used to create groups and clusters. Since the data is unlabeled, the machine must discover unknown patterns and structures. For example, getting images of animals and classifying them into clusters learned automatically based on the data.</li><br>
                    <li>Reinforcement learning - provides training feedback using a reward an  punishment mechanism; the Agent can interact with the environment and can try a variety of methods to reach an outcome. It is then rewarded or punished when it reaches a desirable or undesirable state.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Today I will explore a few supervised machine learning algorithms: linear regression, logistic regression, decision tress and K-nearest neighbours. This is just an overview of how they work; I will not include any code here. More in depth analysis of these algorithms are coming soon. Let's get started...</p>

                <h4>Linear Regression</h4>
                <p>This is the most basic type of regression, where a set of input variables (x) are used to determine an output (y). The relatonship between x and y are expressed as an equation in the form y=mx+c, thus the goal is to find the values of m and c which best quantifies this relationship.</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <h4>Logistic Regression</h4>
                <p>Logistic regression predicts discrete values, best suited for binary classification: data sets where the output is either 0 or 1. For example, whether a student has passed or failed. The logistic function, or sigmoid function is y(x) = 1 / (1 + e^(-x)), which output the probability of y. The output y is generated using this function and a threshold is then applied to force this probability into a binary classification.</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <h4>Decision Trees</h4>
                <p>Decision trees are a common way of representing the decision-making process through a branching, tree-like structure. Itâ€™s often used to plan and plot business and operational decisions as a visual flowchart. The approach sees a branching of decisions which end at outcomes, resulting in a tree-like structure or visualisation.</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <h4>K-nearest Neighbours</h4>
                <p>Unlike the other algorithms which split the data into a training set and a test set, KNN uses the entire data set as a training set. As the name suggests, it considers K nearest data points to predict the class or continuous value for a new datapoint. Here is how it works: consider the figure below, which has a total of 3 red and 3 green data points, each representing a different class. The yellow point is a new data point for which a class it to be predicted. We can see in this example that when K is 3, the point would belong to the green class, while if K is 7, the point would belong to red.</p>
